Potential features / ideas:
  - Add to all popular Eve-related subreddits
  
  
Bug list:
  - Killmail URLs ending with something other than /kill/<number> result in bugs.
  - If killmail is strikenthrough it replies without any scraped information. (Ex: http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/36wwbo/the_scope_jackdaw_enters_caldari_navy_service/crhs44k)
  - If NPCs are responsible for the most damage killing blow player name may end up as ammo.
  - Killer's alliance sometimes incorrectly displays <No Alliance>. Ex: (https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3ecvdv/moa_coercer_never_stood_a_chance/ctdpmo1)
  - Ship name of pilot scoring the killing blow is incorrectly the ship-type of top damaging pilot instead.
